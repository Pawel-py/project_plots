Wishing you all an extraordinary 2024 filled with inspiration and success! 🌿 We're thrilled to share our commitment to the GREENO2 project, coordinated by the University of TUSCIA and co-financed by the Erasmus+ program.
GREENO2 aims to transform higher education institutions into sustainable centers for research, participation, environmental awareness, and oxygen generation. 🌍 Over the next three years, we will promote solutions for both vertical and horizontal greenery, actively engaging the academic community in environmental conservation and enhancing well-being in higher education.
Online education will play a pivotal role in increasing environmental awareness through the practice of ""green roofs"" and sustainable solutions. Recognizing the pivotal role of universities in fostering sustainable development and addressing climate change, GREENO2 is dedicated to turning green roofs into spaces for research, participation, and environmental awareness, involving university staff and students actively.

The recent kickoff meeting in Athens was a success, with a multidisciplinary partnership from various nations. This collaboration between universities, non-profit organizations, and businesses is a significant step toward achieving our common goals.
With confidence, we look ahead to the next 36 months, during which we will work together to turn GREENO2's vision into reality. Wishing you all a year full of inspiration, innovation, and success. 🌱

Intensive use rooftop gardens are areas that have been designed for intensive human use, much like traditional gardens at ground level. These gardens can be an attractive alternative to traditional gardens, especially in urban areas where green space is limited. Extensive-use rooftop gardens, on the other hand, are designed not to be used intensively by people. These are gardens that are typically designed for viewing rather than for use as recreational or leisure space. These gardens are designed to be easy to maintain and provide environmental benefits, while not being designed for intensive human use. In addition, there are other categories of rooftop gardens, such as mixed-use gardens, which combine elements of both intensive and extensive use of the space.

122126696894163851,202568946272592,GreenO2,,"FUNCTIONS OF GREEN ROOFS
Green roofs in cities play an important role, bringing a number of benefits to the urban environment, the community and the buildings themselves. First and foremost, they improve air quality. Plants on green roofs absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants, helping to improve the city's air quality. In addition, green roofs help mitigate the urban heat island effect by absorbing and reflecting solar radiation, which in turn contributes to lower temperatures within urban areas. Green roofs increase water retention. The substrate on green roofs absorbs rainwater, reducing the amount of precipitation that goes into urban drains. This also helps reduce the risk of urban flooding. Another function is natural thermal insulation, which reduces the loss of heat from buildings in winter and the heating of buildings in summer. In addition, the thermal insulation offered by green roofs can help reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling buildings, which in turn reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Undoubtedly, an additional advantage of green roofs is the aesthetics and general improvement of public spaces. They contribute to improving the aesthetics of urban landscapes. They can also be used as recreational spaces, rooftop gardens or meeting places for residents. In addition, plants on green roofs provide habitat for biodiversity, including insects, birds and other small organisms, supporting local biodiversity in the urban environment. The introduction of green roofs is part of sustainable urban development, promoting harmonious cooperation with the surrounding environment. Green roofs are therefore an important part of urban planning, contributing to the creation of more sustainable and environmentally friendly urban areas. Their various benefits are making them increasingly popular for construction projects around the world.
